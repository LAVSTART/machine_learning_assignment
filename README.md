Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Analysis of CaTiO₃

This project focuses on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze the structural, thermodynamic, and phase-dependent behavior of Calcium Titanate (CaTiO₃).
Using LAMMPS, Python, and various ML models, the project evaluates stability, lattice behavior, energy variations, diffusion, and temperature-dependent properties
🔬 Objectives

Perform MD simulations of CaTiO₃ under varying temperature & pressure.

Extract structural features: RDF, MSD, lattice constants, energy curves.

Use Machine Learning (Random Forest, Regression, Neural Networks) to:

Predict thermodynamic properties

Classify structural phases

Estimate stability indicators

Compare MD outputs with ML-predicted behavior.
